# Stackla Widgets in Sitecore
Stackla widgets in Sitecore project helps you to bring a user-generated content on social networks to a Sitecore-powered website via integration with [Stackla](https://stackla.com/) - a world leading visual content engine aggregating the selected content from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Flickr, Pinterest and presents it in a clean & visual interface.

# Introduction
As soon as registered for a specific Stackla product, you will be granted access to Stackla Dashboard where you can create a new widget. Simply go to **Engage > Widgets > Create New Widget** and select one from the available *Widget Types* depending on your license entitlements, next create a filter to specify what social content you would like to load and in what order present items. Once all settings have been completed, your widget code will be generated in the *Embed Code* tab. You will simply need to click on a *Copy* button to get the entire widget code and then paste that embed code into your Sitecore module.

## Integration
Stackla offers three API options for flexible integration: JavaScript, REST and Webhooks.

The Stackla widgets in Sitecore project gives you a few approaches of how to integrate a Stackla widget into a Sitecore site.

### Embed Code
If you do not plan to change any setting dynamically depending on a specific page where your Stackla widget is placed on then you can use a static *EmbedCodeStacklaWidget.cshtml* view approach on your website with relevant settings to you.



## License
The Stackla widgets in Sitecore module is released under the MIT license what means that you can modify and use it how you want even for commercial use. Please give it a star if you like it and your experience was positive.
