# Stackla Widgets in Sitecore
Stackla widgets in Sitecore project helps you to bring a user-generated content on social networks to a Sitecore-powered website via integration with [Stackla](https://stackla.com/) - a world leading visual content engine aggregating the selected content from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, YouTube, Flickr, Pinterest and presents it in a clean & visual interface.

## Integration
Stackla offers three API options for flexible integration: JavaScript, REST and Webhooks.

The Stackla widgets in Sitecore project gives you a few approaches of how to integrate a Stackla widget into a Sitecore site.

### Embed Code
If you do not plan to change any setting dynamically depending on a specific page where your Stackla widget is placed on then you can use a static *EmbedCodeStacklaWidget.cshtml* view approach on your website with relevant settings to you.
